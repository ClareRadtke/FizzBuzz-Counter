# FizzBuzz Counter

## Challenge:

Write a program that outputs a counter that can be incremented or decremented. But for multiples
of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. For numbers
which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”.

## Usage

In your terminal type:

- `npm i` to install all required packages
- `npm run build` to build the app for production
<!-- - `npm run start:server` to run the production build of the app -->

## Prerequisites

- [x] Node.js web application:
  - [x] Can be built using webpack or any other build tools as desired
  - [ ] Is supported and setup to use a testing framework
- [x] All code committed to GitHub (small progressive commits)
- [ ] Logic supported through use of unit tests
