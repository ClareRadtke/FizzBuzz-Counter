# FizzBuzz Counter

## Challenge:

Write a program that outputs a counter that can be incremented or decremented. But for multiples
of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. For numbers
which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”.

## Usage

- `npm i` to install all required packages
- `npm run build` to build the app for production
<!-- - `npm run start:server` to run the production build of the app -->

## Testing

In your terminal type:

- `npm run test` to run all tests
